Cable
=====
The `master` branch depends on a CAS service for authentication. If you want to try the application out, you can clone the `noauth` branch and start from there.

`git clone -b noauth https://github.com/dongliu/cable.git`

The `general` branch was developed for the original use cases.

The `frib` branch is currently active for recent frib use cases.
